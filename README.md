# RomanHLWASTools

This is the set of tools used for tiling the Roman HLWAS in the survey definition committee report.

## Building the tiling

The `surveyscript/` directory contains an iPython notebook, `tiling.ipynb`, that builds the list of pointings. It first builds maps of the sky properties, then builds a survey footprint, then tiles it, and finally outputs the survey information. The internal map projection used for `tiling.ipynb` is Equatorial, Cylindrical Equal Area.

Inputs used:
* The SFD dust map (`ebv_1e4.dat.gz`: this is a flat gzipped text file in the required projection, in units of 1e-4 magnitudes).
* The table of slew and settle times provided by the Roman project, `slew-settle-table.txt` (first column is the slew angle in degrees, the second is the slew and settle time in seconds).
* `bscat.dat` is a table of stars to avoid (colums are RA in degrees; Dec in degrees; J band AB mag from 2MASS) â€” the tiling code moves pointings that contain these objects.
* `letters.dat` is a bitmap for labeling plots.

The outputs include various values and plots in the iPython notebook itself. It also includes three output files:
* `skychart.png`: a map of the sky showing the Medium and Wide regions
* `footprint.fits`: a FITS image of the sky with WCS (suitable for being imported into another application)
* `hlwas_tiling.txt`: a table of the pointings that were generated

**The output tiling file used for the report can be found in** `tilingdata/hlwas_tiling_241206.txt.gz`**.**

## Making coverage maps

The simple module `coveragemap.py` is provided for making detailed FITS coverage maps from the list of tilings and a WCS for the coverage map. This is best done following the example in `example_coverage.py`, which calls the tiling file `tilingdata/hlwas_tiling_241206.txt.gz` (as used in the HLWAS survey definition committee report). See also the instructions in `coverage_multiexp` (in `coveragemap.py`).

These maps take into account field distortions and are good for, e.g., survey window functions and effects of chip gaps, but the distortion map is a cubic approximation and has errors of a few arcsec.

Note that the example (covering 8x8 degrees at 1 sample every 7.2 arcsec) is designed to run in ~ 1 hour on a laptop; mosaiced maps of the whole survey will take a lot longer.
